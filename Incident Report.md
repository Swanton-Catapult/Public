## Executive Summary

### Risk to a protected area

The sold volume of coffee beans reported from Farm [UC-FID-135](https://goo.gl/maps/ppYLv2LxCU6YCr8y6) increased substantially during 2021, suggesting the use of additional land areas for production. Earth observation suggests that additional forest clearing occurred on land contiguous to Farm UC-FID-135 in the first quarter of 2018.

### Recommended immediate actions 

We recommend contacting the cooperative to confirm the expected production capacity of Farm **UC-FID-135**, and exploring the possibility of supplies from nearby illegally converted areas being ‘laundered’ here.
